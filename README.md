# ShareCircle

**ShareCircle** is a digital sharing platform built under the Circular Impact Network initiative. It enables communities to share, borrow, and repurpose items with ease.

## Core Features
- Group-based material sharing (Share Groups)
- Smart item cataloging with images & metadata
- Borrow/Reserve/Return workflows with reminders
- Ratings for lenders and borrowers
- AI-powered redistribution (Facebook Marketplace etc.)

## Guiding Principles
- **Convenience** is key – If it's not easy, it won't scale
- Use **accessible technology** – Low-barrier tools that work on basic devices.
- Encourage **continuous improvement** – Test fast, learn, and adapt.
- Design for **flexible sharing models** – Support both structured and free-form sharing
- Community-driven – Solutions must empower local groups and individual agency.
- Minimal infrastructure dependency – Avoid models that need lockers, staff, or physical inventory.
